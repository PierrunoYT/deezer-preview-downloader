# 🎉 Project Complete: State-of-the-Art Deezer Downloader

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL LIMITATION: Full Track Downloads Do Not Work**

**This tool only supports 30-second preview downloads.** Full track downloads are impossible due to Deezer's 2024 CDN infrastructure changes. All CDN endpoints for full tracks are inaccessible.
